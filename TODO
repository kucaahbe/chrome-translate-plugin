current:
* If your extension uses window.setTimeout() or window.setInterval(), switch to using the alarms API instead. DOM-based timers won't be honored if the event page shuts down.
* If you're using message passing, be sure to close unused message ports. The event page will not shut down until all message ports are closed.

for future:
add menu item for single translation invocation
